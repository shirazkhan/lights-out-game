# Lights Out Game

## Introduction
Just a quick lights out game I made using React JS. Originally, Lights Out was an electronic game released by Tiger Electronics in 1995.

## Gameplay
The game consists of a 5 by 5 grid of lights. When the game starts, a random number of these lights is switched on. Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the four adjacent lights.

## Objective
The goal of the puzzle is to switch all the lights off, preferably in as few button presses as possible.
